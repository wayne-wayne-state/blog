<h1 class="p2">Inspirational Concept Art </h1>

<p class="p1" id="rcorners1">Hello, my name is Wayne Landon Hearns II and my blog is going to be about Concept art. Ever since I was a child I have loved drawing, and as I got older, I realized that there were a lot of routes you can go with drawing. You can go animation, graphic design, Industrial design, Environmental or Comics but I realized I had passion for being a Monster concept artist/digital illustrator. That is my passion and that is my main goal so I thought it would be cool to post about other different amazing concept artists to motivate others and see and talk about others work in the industry.  

In the artist world, many artists face a lot of hard nights, risk of burning out on artist, and the biggest problem is lack of motivation. So the purpose for this blog is to help motivate artist and to look at fresh Ideas from great artist around the world. </p>
